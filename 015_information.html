        The overall feel of the event will be a cocktail party, so don't feel pressure to get super fancy.
        Colors like mint/turquoise and coral would fit in nicely.
        Expect warm, sunny weather. There is a breeze on the lake at night, so consider bringing something warm for later in the evening.

        Appetizers will be served throughout the night, and there will be snacks at the bar.
        We plan to have options for vegans and vegetarians.
        There will also be a delicious cake (vegan).
        If you think you may need a little more, consider grabbing something beforehand.
